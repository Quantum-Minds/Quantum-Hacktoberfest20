Important resources for Quantum Machine Learning:

1. If you need some ML refreshment then please follow this link:
https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.00-machine-learning.html.
This free online book has a great introduction to python and data science in general. Besides, it contains great material on Scikit-Learn.

2. If you need a good introduction to Linear Algebra and the mathematics behind ML:
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning. This specialization will show the most important topics of which you should be aware.

3. If you need a good introduction to Quantum Computing:
 https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html. Qiskit textbook is a great place to start your journey to the QC realm. It’s intuitive, straightforward, and interactive.

7. How to use Qiskit in an optimization problem “Solving IBM Quantum Challenge by machine learning”:
  https://bit.ly/2ZHksvN 
8. This is an external resource but it’s very rich in its content:
  https://pennylane.ai/qml/demonstrations.html. PennyLane is a QML framework that makes it easy to calculate gradients. It can also be integrated easily with Tensorflow and PyTorch frameworks. Another important feature is that it can be integrated with Qiskit. Just imagine the possibilities.
Another useful tutorial on Hybrid architectures:  https://bit.ly/30oiHmm
